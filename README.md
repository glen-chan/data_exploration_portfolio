In this repository you will find the files for an example of data exploration using Mysql. 
This is actually a test I took a few years ago for a job opportunity. 
They provided me the instructions (Test instructions.pdf) and I created the schema and added some data (TestStructures.sql). 
You can find the solution in the file: Solution.sql.
